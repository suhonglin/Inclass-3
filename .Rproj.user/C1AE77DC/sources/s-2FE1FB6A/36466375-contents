This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
c(2L, 'a', 3.0, 4)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
student <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/course-107-1-programming-for-data-science/master/data/student.csv")
cols(
  入學年 = col_character(),
  出生地 = col_character(),
  性別 = col_character(),
  身高 = col_double()
)
```

```{r}
table(student$入學年)
```

```{r}
levels(student$入學年)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
